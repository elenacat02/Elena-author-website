          Hi! I’m Elena, an illustrator and writer creating art and stories for
          kids who love ​adventure, animals, and a touch of mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether I’m painting with watercolors or working digitally, I strive
          to bring as ​much color and life to the page as possible. My
          illustrations are full of whimsical ​details and little surprises for
          viewers to discover each time they look.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of writing and illustrating, I’m pursuing a career in animal
          ​behavior research. I recently graduated with a B.S. in Ecology and
          ​Evolutionary Biology and a B.A. in Theatre from Rice University.
          ​While in college, I had the chance to work on projects ranging ​from
          training birds to studying how a guide dog’s early ​experiences shape
          its behavior. My knowledge of animals often ​finds its way into my art
          and stories— but blended with fun, ​fantastical elements.
        </p>
